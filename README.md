---
* The aviation industry in India is witnessing rapid growth, with multiple airlines operating flights across various cities. However, the prices of air tickets are highly dynamic, influenced by a multitude of factors such as demand, timing, airline reputation, and more. For both airlines and passengers, predicting these prices with accuracy is crucial for maximizing revenue and ensuring affordability.
* This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the air ticket prices for flights within India. By analyzing data from different airlines and flights between various cities, the model will identify key factors affecting ticket pricing and provide insights to enhance decision-making processes for stakeholders.
